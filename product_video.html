This classic top-loader—with a simple, single-pull main closure that makes loading a cinch–is made with a lightweight yet durable fabric for a pack that’s equally at home on the trail or the train.

To make loading and unloading this pack a cinch, we looked to the open-and-shut style of a climbing chalkbag. With a user-friendly design and a size that’s perfect for cruising around town or drifting through the hills, our Lightweight Black Hole™ Cinch Pack keeps your gear organized without slowing your pace. It’s made from lightweight yet seriously tough ripstop nylon with a TPU-film laminate and a DWR (durable water repellent) finish that resists abrasion and protects your gear from the elements. The clean, top-loading design features a single-pull closure, a simple main compartment that holds enough for a day’s outing and an internal hydration-compatible sleeve. A front, zippered stash pocket carries the easily lost details of life—phone, keys and wallet—and a micro daisy chain provides lash points for a yoga mat or an extra sweater. Open, highly breathable mesh shoulder straps and back panel provide breathable comfort to keep you cool during hot weather. A top, reinforced haul handle allows you to carry the Cinch Pack tote-bag style. Made from 7.1-oz 210-denier 100% nylon ripstop with a TPU-film laminate and a DWR (durable water repellent) finish.
